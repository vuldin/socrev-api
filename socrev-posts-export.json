Since the turn of the century, the US has experienced its worst drug epidemic ever. At the forefront is the family of drugs known as opioids, which includes Oxycontin, heroin, and fentanyl. Between 2002 and 2015, the number of deaths from opioid overdose has quadrupled. As of 2015, the number of fatalities from opioid overdoses now outpaces both gun-related deaths and car accident fatalities.</p>\n<p>The significant change in the last period is that opioid abuse has shifted from being more prevalent in urbanized states to more rural ones. The data clearly shows where and whom the epidemic is hitting hardest: working class people living in the Rust Belt and the Northeast, most of whom are involved in the construction trades and going through middle age, with whites overdosing at a rate almost double that of Hispanics and blacks.</p>\n<p>The highest rates of deaths reported are among adults between ages 45 and 54, while the construction industries have a rate of opioid use up to 10% higher than any other industry. Construction is incredibly stressful on the human body. After several years in the building trades, many workers find their bodies damaged to the point of causing pain so constant and severe it becomes impossible to work. But instead of allowing these workers the necessary time to heal up before returning to the job, they are forced to rely on pain medications to enable them to work through the day to feed their families. In a rising number of cases, a simple prescription from their doctor is not a permanent fix to their situation.</p>\n<p>As workers continue to take their prescribed medications, their bodies begin to develop a tolerance to the drug. Thus, the workers who are desperately searching for a way to ease chronic pain are forced to use higher and higher dosages or seek more potent opioids. To do so, many individuals find ways to receive multiple prescriptions, from various doctors. The proof of this is quite clear: in several states with some of the highest overdose rates, the number of opioid prescriptions exceeds the number of people in the state!</p>\n<p>Why, then, are doctors continuing to write so many prescriptions in the midst of this deadly epidemic? The answer lies in the evident fact that it is profitable in the context of a market-based health care system. Drug companies spend billions of dollars to motivate doctors to continue to prescribe their products. California alone reported $1.44 billion spent from August 2013 to December 2015. Thus, the market compels doctors to put profits before patients with decisions that are potentially fatal to the very people they are supposed to care for. Many doctors also seem to ignore the fact that for many patients, the prescriptions they give are no longer sufficient to ease the pain.</p>\n<p>When someone’s tolerance becomes too high, they are far more likely to resort to self-medication. While it is true that opioid prescriptions have continued to rise in the 21st century, their percentage of overdose-related deaths has not. The sharp spike in deaths from heroin and other illegal opioids runs parallel with a plateau in the number of deaths from prescription opioids. The spike in deaths from illicit opioids can be explained in part because people who have become dependent on prescription opioids feel compelled to turn to illicit versions, not only to numb the pain but also to stave off the effects of withdrawal, which can be just as painful.</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3261\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 6px;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/opioid_ep_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"249\" /></p>\n<p>Finding rehabilitation facilities to assist with overcoming these dependencies is virtually impossible for many workers. Those who do have a facility nearby often find them prohibitively expensive. In 2013 alone, over 300,000 people attempted to get treatment for their addictions but were unable to. As the epidemic worsens, workers across the country are searching for a solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to eradicating the opioid epidemic—and there is no solution within capitalism. It was not the workers who forced their brothers and sisters to work jobs that would cause irreparable harm to their bodies. It was not the workers who bribed doctors to feed potentially habit-forming drugs to their patients. It was not workers who refused to set up the necessary infrastructure to help those afflicted.</p>\n<p>It was the bosses, who care only about their profit margins as the decrepit system of capitalism destroys millions of lives. Their relentless drive for profits has led to a countrywide phenomenon in which workers labor to the point of crippling injury, and instead of being given proper treatment and rest, are drugged to the point of lethality. Only under a planned economy will we be able to set up the infrastructure to treat those affected by this crisis, and eliminate to causes that lead people to abuse drugs and their bodies. The capitalist system, which works people to death and robs them of their dignity, is not only absurd, it is barbaric, and the only way to end it is a socialist revolution.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The crisis of capitalism has had a profound effect on the health and consciousness of the working class, which is expressed in

Scalise is a leading figure in the widely reviled right wing of the Republican Party. After a scandal erupted in 2014 around <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/why_rep_steve_scalise_spoke_to_a_white_nationalist_hate_group_racism_in.html\">his presence as an honored speaker at the 2002 convention of David Duke’s white nationalist group, “EURO,” </a> he issued an “apology,” explaining that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-majority-whip-scalise-confirms-he-spoke-to-white-nationalists-in-2002/2014/12/29/7f80dc14-8fa3-11e4-a900-9960214d4cd7_story.html?utm_term=.579a73203177\">he was unaware of the organization&#8217;s racist nature</a>. Earlier in his political career, he billed himself as <a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/us/politics/much-of-david-dukes-91-campaign-is-now-in-louisiana-mainstream.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0&amp;referer=http%253A%252F%252Ftheweek.com%252Fspeedreads%252F440133%252Fsteve-scalise-reportedly-said-like-david-duke-without-baggage\">“like David Duke without the baggage,”</a> to Louisiana political reporter Stephanie Grace.</p>\n<p>In a world of imperialist militarism, artificial deprivation of <a href=\"news-analysis/letters-interviews/1858-capitalism-s-healthcare-emergency.html\">healthcare </a>and <a href=\"https://www.marxist.com/grenfell-tower-fire-residents-killed-by-callous-capitalists.htm\">housing</a>, daily acts of police brutality and violence against women, Scalise and the American ruling class are objectively far more violent and terroristic than his would-be killer. While condemning acts of individual terrorism, even against someone as unsympathetic as Scalise, our solidarity is on the side of the mass victims of terrorism. For example: the civilians massacred by the Islamic State in the <a href=\"https://www.marxist.com/iraq-falling-apart-the-forces-behind-the-insurgency.htm\">sectarian warfare set off and fueled by Bush and Obama</a>; the concert-goers and pedestrians in Manchester and London, <a href=\"https://www.marxist.com/london-terrorist-attack-don-t-let-the-tories-talk-of-our-values.htm\">attacked by the Frankenstein monsters of Western imperialism</a>; and the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/29/portland-teenager-tells-haunted-murder-defenders/\">Portlanders whose throats were cut by an abusive racist</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\" alignleft size-full wp-image-3257\" style=\"margin: 6px; float: left;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/saada-yemen.jpg\" alt=\"saada yemen\" width=\"263\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/saada-yemen.jpg 1400w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/saada-yemen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/saada-yemen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/saada-yemen-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" /></p>\n<p>Precisely for this reason, we must emphasize the class division in society between the exploited and the exploiters, as well as the fact that violence and terrorism are the spawn of a system of <a href=\"https://www.marxist.com/isis-close-to-defeat-as-imperialists-prepare-for-war.htm\">war and imperialism</a>. For their part, the right wing and the establishment are working to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/opinions/leftist-terrorism-bergen-sterman-opinion/index.html\">smear socialism with the charge of terrorism</a>, a cynically hypocritical maneuver in contrast to their unruffled attitude towards far-right terrorists like Sean Urbanski and James Harris Jackson.</p>\n<p>The capitalist ruling class routinely uses state terror, such as police repression and Predator drone missiles, to defend their interests, while individuals turn to this tactic out of desperation. In the epoch of declining capitalism, terrorism has given bleak outlet to expressions of alienation and murderous chauvinism, especially in places like the Middle East, where Islamic fundamentalism has been animated as an agent of counterrevolution and imperialism in the region. By contrast, the working class, the only class that can end the violence and crises inherent in capitalism, has a social outlook of solidarity and united struggle. Its methods are not individualistic, but collective: mass strikes, occupations, and demonstrations. In fact, terrorism is fundamentally alien and poisonous to the workers’ struggle; it serves to embolden state repression and the ruling class while it sidelines and disorients the masses.</p>\n<p>The shooter, James Hodgkinson, was a <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-james-hodgkinson-shooter-0616-20170615-story.html\">dispossessed small businessman</a> squeezed by the post-2007 economic crisis. Ironically, Scalise and other right-populists base themselves on demagogic appeals to the same desperate petty bourgeois elements, encouraging them to swing to the right—towards chauvinism and against organized labor. The petty bourgeois are right-populism&#8217;s natural base as they occupy a necessarily unstable and untenable position in society, caught between the struggle of labor and capital and regularly driven to ruin by capitalist crises they cannot understand or resolve. Reactionary charlatans like Scalise can harness their frustration to defend the same system responsible for it.</p>\n<p>However, the “small capitalist” middle class is not automatically on the side of the monopoly capitalist ruling class. A confident appeal from a fighting working class leadership can win them over and offer a genuine way out of the crisis. This was the case for Hodgkinson last year, when he energetically dedicated himself to <img class=\" alignright size-full wp-image-3258\" style=\"margin: 6px; float: right;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hodgkinson-protesting.jpg\" alt=\"hodgkinson protesting\" width=\"225\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hodgkinson-protesting.jpg 620w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hodgkinson-protesting-300x234.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" />Bernie Sanders’s reformist socialist campaign. But betrayal is inherent in reformism, as was evident in <a href=\"news-analysis/us-politics/1853-the-dead-end-of-the-dnc-unity-tour.html\">Sanders’ capitulation to the DNC</a>, and reformist betrayal without a revolutionary alternative is a dangerous impasse. It appears Hodgkinson fell into demoralization and isolation, eventually making the short-sighted, individualistic, and genuinely stupid kind of decision that middle-class activists inevitably make without the guidance of an inspiring labor movement.</p>\n<p>Chickens come home to roost and poison pollutes everyone’s water. The same unstable petty-bourgeois outlook and individualism Scalise thrives on turned on him with fifty rounds of gunfire from a most unexpected source—“Main Street” Middle America. It is worth adding that while Hodgkinson is neither right-wing nor an enforcer for the ruling class, he does share at least one telltale sign with many other terrorists—<a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2017/06/14/congress-baseball-shooter-james-hodgkinson-arrest-record/\">a record of domestic violence</a>. Scalise, of course, voted against the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.</p>\n<p>Dog-eat-dog individualism and violence is the status quo of capitalist life, and we are living in a period of international crisis, war, revolution, and counterrevolution. The rotten politics of Scalise feed off the poisonous actions of Hodgkinson, and vice versa. To oppose both, we must fight capitalism with a mass socialist movement and party of the working class.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Wednesday, June 14, Americans received the jarring news that a US Congressman had been shot down during practice for a bipartisan baseball

Vows to Leave the Paris Accord"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><img class=\" alignleft size-full wp-image-3252\" style=\"margin: 6px; float: left;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/trump_this-much.jpg\" alt=\"trump this much\" width=\"352\" height=\"249\" />President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the Paris accord. After a fraught meeting with the other G7 countries, he unilaterally withdrew from the accords. This marks a decisive turning point in world relations and shows the inability of capitalism to create a sustainable future for humanity on this planet.</p>\n<p>The Paris agreement of 2015 set targets for emissions reduction. Trump’s stated intent is to revive industries hurt by environmental efforts, such as coal mining, and to eliminate payments promised to the Green Climate Fund, which helps emissions reduction efforts in developing countries. He wants to, as he says, put “America first”.</p>\n<p>During his campaign, Trump promised his supporters that he would leave the Paris accord. However, sections of the US ruling class, including the CEOs of Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP, fearing a loss of diplomatic influence, were mounting a last ditched attempt to stop him.</p>\n<p>Trump claims to be willing to re-negotiate the terms of the agreement or broker a new deal on climate change, but representatives from France, Germany, and Italy have stated that a renegotiation is impossible. Given the difficulty world leaders encountered in brokering the original deal, and the terms on which Trump wants to negotiate, it would simply be impossible.</p>\n<h4>The Paris Accords</h4>\n<p>The Paris agreement (also known as COP21) was considered a major breakthrough, after the previous agreement in 2009 failed to bring significant change in emissions. Most countries represented at the conference signed the deal to keep global temperature increases below 2°C, decreasing every five years until it reaches net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>\n<p>The agreement was passed without any legally-binding mandate, and each country was allowed to submit their own targets for emissions reduction. Former President Obama pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025 as compared to 2005 levels. It was a toothless agreement and insufficient for the task it set itself. Yet, it had a certain impact. It did prepare a set of measures in different countries, albeit insufficient, to move to reduce emissions.</p>\n<p>The Paris accord was in a sense the crowning achievement of globalization and international cooperation in the sphere of the environment. But environmental protection, just like free trade, depends on each national capitalist class looking above their narrow national interest for the global interests of the capitalist class. But it’s one thing to share out the profits between different nations, it’s another to share out losses.</p>\n<h4>Rise of protectionism</h4>\n<p>The crisis of capitalism that began in 2007 has created a powerful impetus towards protectionism. In order to solve the social and political problems at home, it becomes very tempting to attempt to export unemployment to someone else. It is basically the policy of the right wing of the Conservative Party in Britain, and it is also the policy of Trump. The problem, of course, is that this only works as long as the other country or countries don&#8217;t retaliate, which they typically would. This is what pushed the economy into the slump in the 1930s, and it is what is on the cards right now.</p>\n<p>Trump’s “America First” policy is for that reason a serious threat to the stability of world capitalism. The US is the world’s largest economy. The world capitalist class could probably stomach the loss of a climate accord. Even increased costs associated with storms, hurricanes etc. is nothing compared to a breakdown in world trade and a deep slump. That’s what they can’t forgive about Trump.</p>\n<p>Trump’s noises about NATO, asking the other members to cough up, is similar. It signals the US partial withdrawal from its commitments to the interests of the world capitalist class, in terms of defence and security. This is why Merkel says that the EU might have to look after its own security in the future.</p>\n<p>The row over the Paris accord is not because the European leaders are more progressive than the US, it’s because they see the US drifting towards protectionism, and abandoning its role as the guarantor of free trade on a world scale. This development began already under Obama, with a significant increase in the number of protectionist measures taken by the US government, but Trump’s “America First” accelerates the process.</p>\n<p>It’s also for this reason that the Democratic side of the establishment has been so keen to prove their environmentalist credentials. It’s not because they are really progressive in any sense, but that they see, like their European counterparts that the future of globalization and free trade is at stake.</p>\n<h4>Leaving Paris Won’t Fix Capitalism</h4>\n<p><img class=\" alignright size-full wp-image-3253\" style=\"margin: 6px; float: right;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/trump_holdingsign_digs-coal.jpg\" alt=\"trump holdingsign digs coal\" width=\"340\" height=\"204\" />Abandoning the Paris agreement will do nothing to alleviate the suffering of the US masses. Despite popular support for leaving from economically depressed regions like the rust belt, the reality is that leaving the Paris agreement will do nothing to create new jobs in the coal industry or bring back jobs to the United States that have migrated overseas. The crisis of capitalism means that there isn’t an economic need to expand coal production since capitalists are not building new factories or expanding production when there is already an overproduction of commodities. Plus, cheaper energy sources such as natural gas and, to a lesser degree, wind and solar power, are pushing out coal as a natural result of market forces.</p>\n<h4>Environment in Crisis</h4>\n<p>The Paris agreement in itself was not enough to reverse a century of rising emissions. The pledges made by the signers of the agreement were not enough to achieve the target of no more than 2°C rising global temperatures, and nothing in the agreement actually held countries to their pledges. Generally speaking, the costs associated with switching to renewable energy or changing the technology used in production to emit less greenhouse gas are too high for capitalists to make that change, especially in the middle of a serious economic crisis, when there is limited prospects of recovering the investments. The short-term view of the capitalists, with the drive to profit or perish, makes considerations about the environment in 50 or 100 years hopelessly remote, and so long as they can keep producing the capitalists don’t care about the impact of climate change on natural food sources, catastrophic weather events, or smog-filled cities.</p>\n<p>This is not a new phenomenon. As Engels explained in 1876:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“As individual capitalists are engaged in production and exchange for the sake of immediate profit, only the nearest, most immediate results must first be taken into account…What cared the Spanish planters in Cuba, who burned down the forests on the slopes of the mountains and obtained from the ashes sufficient fertiliser for one generation of highly profitable coffee trees – what cared they that heavy tropical rainfall afterwards washed away the unprotected upper stratum of soil, leaving behind only bare rock! In relation to nature, as to society, the present mode of production is predominantly concerned only about the immediate, most tangible result, and then surprise is expressed that the more remote effects of actions directed to this end turn out to be quite different, are mostly quite opposite in character.” (Engels – Part played by labour in the transition from ape to man).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Only socialism can end the destruction of the environment, with a democratically planned economy that takes into account both short-term and long-term needs of the Earth and the people on it.</p>\n<h4>Socialist Program for the Environment</h4>\n<p>Whether or not Trump can actually complete the exit from the Paris agreement, there is no room under capitalism to make significant changes needed to counteract climate change and prevent an economic and humanitarian disaster. Only when the working class has control over the commanding heights of the economy &#8211; the largest companies, the banks, and the status apparatus &#8211; can we create an economy that plans for the long term, and develops in a sustainable way.</p>\n<p>Much of the technology to make an abundance of clean energy already exists. To make clean energy the norm, rather than the exception, requires massive investment, but the capitalists have no incentive to use their vast resources for the common good.</p>\n<p>A socialist program for the environment starts with the public ownership and control over natural resources, including mining, oil, and gas. As we transition to cleaner, renewable energy, all displaced workers will be guaranteed paid retraining and full employment. We will expand solar and wind power to all people, not just the advanced capitalist countries, and we will restore forests and natural habitats that have been damaged. The working class needs an earth to live on, not just today, but for generations to come.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the

Tendency, Marxism is the historical memory of the working class. In its struggle with the bourgeoisie, the victories, defeats, traditions, and hopes of the workers are distilled and synthesized into a revolutionary theory of action. This “unbroken thread” extends back in time, an uninterrupted line of thought beginning with Marx and Engels, developed further by Lenin and Trotsky, and taken into the modern epoch by those who have worked for world revolution since Trotsky’s death. It is by grasping this thread that generations of revolutionaries were able to hold out against the pressures of difficult times, to maintain and hold high the banner of Bolshevism. This is the reason we have access to these ideas and methods today, and are in a position to rally and build the forces of Marxism in the USA—the proverbial “belly of the beast.” No country is more central to the global market system, making it the stage for the most absurd and contradictory developments plaguing capitalism in its senile decay.</p>\n<p>The extraordinary 2017 Congress of the US section of the IMT was called in response to the earthshaking events unfolding around us and represents a significant new milestone in our work. We normally convene a Congress only every two years, but the events of the last 12 months necessitated a full discussion of our perspectives, targets, and tasks. Meeting the weekend of May 27–28 in Pittsburgh, over 80 comrades and sympathizers traveled from 20 cities and 5 different countries to take part in our largest National Congress yet, with the participation of more delegates than ever before. The logistical execution, enthusiasm, and high level of participation showed the rising professionalism and political education achieved by the comrades just one year since our last Congress.</p>\n<p>After several months of preparation and discussion within the branches during the pre-Congress period, contributions during each of the sessions on World Perspectives, Perspectives for Revolution in the US, our Organizational Resolution for 2017, and discussions on Marxism and the Struggle Against Oppression displayed a keen awareness of the shifts in consciousness and conditions facing us today.</p>\n<p>Only a few years ago, our perspectives explained that the period we were passing through could be described as the “calm before the storm”. While we are still in the stage of building the IMT in the US on the basis of the “ones-and-twos”—winning over the most advanced elements of our class to revolutionary socialism—we have now entered a period of greater instability playing out within the political, economic, and social structures of American capitalism. With the stage set for further polarization and crisis, the mood among comrades was a sober, yet optimistic sense of duty to understand and prepare for the years ahead, which will present many opportunities as well as challenges. The situation is sure to grow only more favorable for the spreading of our ideas, while the need to urgently build the organization has never been so apparent.</p>\n<h4>World Perspectives</h4>\n<p>The first session of the Congress was led off by Fred Weston from the IMT’s International Secretariat in London. Fred began by laying out the main trends leading to the economic stagnation and political strife that has been lurching from one country to the next in the last few years.</p>\n<p>Marx understood long ago that the measure of an economic system’s progressive character lies in its ability to develop the productive forces of society. For capitalism to justify its continued existence, it must “deliver the goods.” For the vast majority of humanity, this is no longer, and in some situations, has never been, the case. Having used up all the tools at its disposal for avoiding a crisis as occurred in 2008—such as quantitative easing and a massive expansion of credit—the parasitism of the system has now been completely laid bare. Sitting on over $7 trillion in cash reserves and further enriching themselves through purely speculative, unproductive means, the capitalists refuse to invest in real production given that there already exist too many goods in circulation than the market can absorb. This fact strikes at the heart of the capitalist system, pointing out a fundamental contradiction resulting in recurring crises of overproduction, vindicating one of Marx’s most famous statements from the Communist Manifesto:</p>\n<p>“Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ve pointed out since the beginning of the crisis that all attempts to regain economic stability will only serve to upset the fragile political and social equilibrium which the system depends on. Everywhere, especially in Europe, this perspective has continued to ring true. Among the youth, this ferment is given its earliest and sharpest expression: among countries most affected by the crisis such as Spain, Greece, Italy, and France, over half of the youth report that they would “support a large-scale uprising against the government!”</p>\n<p>The recent and upcoming elections in France and Britain, the instability rocking Brazil, the looming economic crisis in China, the continuation of proxy wars and civil conflicts worldwide, and the result of the 2016 presidential election in the US have all been further developments which prove that capitalism is tobogganing towards ever-greater uncertainty.</p>\n<p>With all indicators pointing towards another severe global economic downturn just around the corner, the Marxists around the world must have, more than ever, a sense of urgency in building the revolutionary subjective factor to meet with open arms the coming of the world socialist revolution.</p>\n<h4>US Perspectives</h4>\n<p><img class=\" alignright size-full wp-image-3249\" style=\"margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; float: right;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TT_Congress2017.jpg\" alt=\"TT Congress2017\" width=\"317\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TT_Congress2017.jpg 2048w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TT_Congress2017-300x169.jpg 300w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TT_Congress2017-768x432.jpg 768w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TT_Congress2017-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" />This extraordinary Congress was called for due to extraordinary circumstances: the bourgeoisie intends to use the Trump regime as a battering ram to smash down what few walls remain between worker’s rights and hard-won benefits, and the voracious profit-making of the capitalist class. The discussion on Perspectives for the US Revolution was led off by Tom Trottier of the editorial board for Socialist Appeal, who outlined the conditions giving rise to the Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>While the current labor leaders have done next to nothing, or worse, to resist the administration’s agenda, a mood of furious indignation is brewing among the wider population and the youth in particular. Not willing to sit back and watch hardened reactionaries and the most despised administration in generations win the day, and thereby pave the way for even more brutal austerity, millions of people have come out since Trump’s inauguration to protest policies which take aim at virtually everything from the environment to women’s reproductive care, immigrant rights, health care, as well as the wars on workers and the poor overseas through a continuation of the Bush-Obama era foreign policy, and more.</p>\n<p>Above all, these attacks are linked to the impasse of the capitalist system globally. The US has dropped measurably from its undisputed place as the only superpower in the pantheon of imperialism. Whereas the US made up 50% of the world’s total GDP in 1945, today it stands at 25%. While still the most powerful country on the planet, militarily and economically, it has begun to be outstripped by competition from the EU and China, shifting geo-political relationships in such a way as to reduce its ability to project power across the globe, namely in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Likewise, stagnant growth rates of around half the postwar boom levels, low job growth with ever more workers finding their way into the ranks of the “permanently unemployed,” and the fact that the so-called recovery overwhelmingly benefitted the top 1%—who received around 95% of the total income growth over this period—have all found their expression in rapidly declining living standards and a generally pessimistic outlook among people towards their own futures.</p>\n<p>With inequality reaching unprecedented proportions, this process of deterioration has given rise to the polarization—both to the right and the left—that has characterized the last year of US politics, with the dual phenomenon of Sanders and Trump, each in their own way, expressing this trend. While Sanders was defeated and ultimately capitulated to the Democratic Party machine, the Republicans and the bourgeoisie as a whole must now contend with an unreliable servant in President Trump. Though he has been brought to heel on many issues, to the point of going back on several of his more blustering campaign promises, his lack of any legitimacy has done much to dispel illusions in the capitalists’ system.</p>\n<p>A total of 17 amendments were submitted to the US Perspectives, reflecting the vibrant and lively discussion within the branches around crafting our position and orientation going into an exciting new period of our work. The US Perspectives document, as amended by the Congress can be read <a href=\"http://socialistappeal.org/about-us/documents/1847-perspectives-for-the-us-revolution-2017-draft-document.html\">here.</a></p>\n<p>The second day focused on a range of organizational and theoretical discussions, including our Organizational Resolution which established new targets for the attainment of new full-timers, the expansion of our press to include one more issue annually, and setting growth targets to be met by the end of the year. Most notably, the comrades also voted unanimously to officially change the name of our paper from Socialist Appeal, which just published its 100th issue, to Socialist Revolution, in order to more boldly connect our ideas with a new layer of youth and workers who have drawn advanced conclusions, and are already looking around eagerly for revolutionary ideas. Watch for issue one as well as a new website coming soon!</p>\n<p>As a fantastic reaffirmation of our comrade’s commitment to building the IMT in the US, we succeeded in kicking off our Summer Collection with a new record for pledges of nearly $40,000! The members of the US section are willing and proud to make tremendous personal sacrifices to build our organization, confident that such contributions will aid in building the one revolutionary tendency capable of leading a revolutionary movement around the world. Please help support our work <a href=\"https://wellred.org/collections/donate/products/donate-1\">by making a donation in any amount!</a></p>\n<p>In addition to an exciting report on the work of the IMT around the world and a moving commemoration of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution,  the Congress ended with the singing of the Internationale in many languages and versions, followed by the rousing opening verses of Bandiera Rossa. Comrades discussed passionately before, after, and between each of the sessions, sharing experiences, advice, and relating stories from their efforts to build the IMT in all corners of the US.</p>\n<p>The future looks brighter than ever for socialism, and humanity’s potential to achieve it has never been greater. The Marxists of the US section are stepping confidently forward into another year of dramatic shifts, changes, and developments, understanding the key role we are preparing to play in the intervention of history by the masses.<a href=\"http://socialistappeal.org/join-the-imt.html\"> Join us to fight for socialist revolution, and a better world!</a></p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3250\"

Healthcare Emergency"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3245\" style=\"margin: 6px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthcare_crisis.jpg\" alt=\"healthcare crisis\" width=\"380\" height=\"253\" /></p>\n<p>I work as a medical scribe in a large downtown Emergency Department, which means that I am essentially a fly on the wall for hundreds of interactions between patients and healthcare providers. The recent debate around Trumpcare is an example of the constant threat to healthcare under capitalism. In the era of genome sequencing and 3D organ printing, we are still struggling for access to basic care. Marxists call for a socialized, national healthcare system that is free at the point of care for everyone—a demand that can only be realized on the basis of mass mobilizations by a workers’ movement committed to class struggle.</p>\n<p>But the truth is that winning universal access is just one component of the socialist approach to health care. We are not fighting merely for the opportunity to be turfed from one healthcare provider to another, to have our symptoms ignored or dismissed, to be inappropriately drugged, or to be otherwise neglected and mistreated. The crisis of our society, the crisis of capitalism, has its roots in the economy, but its effects branch out into all aspects of our lives, including the ways we directly relate to one another. Nowhere is this truer than in healthcare. Ask many doctors honestly about their field and don’t be surprised to find them talking about a crisis. Based on what I’ve seen, I’m happy to call it that too.</p>\n<p>But the word that sums it all up for me is cynicism. Patients are often judged viciously—comments on bodies, perceived intelligence, emotional expression, you name it, are very common. All it takes is the smallest pretense to dismiss a patient’s stated reason for coming in and substitute it with another: “they just want a work note” or “they’re just here for drugs.” Patients are blamed for their problems. Symptoms, complaints, people’s own self-understanding is dismissed. I’ve heard tactical conversations on how to most quickly get homeless patients back out onto the street because “they’re only here for the food/to be dry/to be warm.” Patients are seen as an annoyance, and allegedly our job is to get them in and out as fast as possible with as little trouble as possible.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are exceptions to this trend, which in many ways are as revealing as the trend itself. The best way to get good treatment from a doctor is to be similar to the doctor. In general (and this is all generalization), doctors come from privileged backgrounds, are well-educated, have stable living situations, more-or-less conventional social arrangements, and disposable income, and access to various leisure activities. If you happen to have these things as well and are capable of conveying it in your immediate presentation, I am willing to bet that you will be listened to more attentively and patiently, consulted more in your care, and offered more comprehensive treatment.</p>\n<p>Barring that, your next best strategy is diffidence. This appeals to the paternalistic element in physician-patient relations. Sensing that you are not here to advocate for yourself, but to appeal to their benevolence, you are likely to get a better listen. However, the downside to this approach is that often aggressively advocating for yourself in these situations is the only way to draw attention, for example, to that symptom that they would otherwise ignore.</p>\n<p>None of this is to say that genuinely sick people do not get treatments that they need, sometimes life-saving ones (although there is always an enormous bill attached). This isn’t to say that providers don’t do extensive, diligent workup on patients or don’t do their best to make diagnoses and establish plans of care. But there are costs to a commodified, poisonous relationship between patients and their healthcare providers. One survey of providers and patients with rare diseases (and here “rare diseases” refers to diseases that affect 25 million Americans or 8% of the US population) found that the average time from onset of symptoms to accurate diagnosis was 7.6 years. Anyone who has or has been around people with chronic illnesses will have no shortage of anecdotes to this effect.</p>\n<p>This is the reality. I have no doubt that many people I work with, if being honest, would not disagree with what I’ve written. Healthcare providers understand how the system and the environment in which they work shape them. The vast majority of healthcare providers enter the field because they are interested in helping other people, in making a concrete, positive difference in people’s lives. They are also often interested in technical and scientific advancements and improving the outcomes of the entire healthcare system. Yet studies designed to measure training doctors’ empathy for their patients show a striking drop in the third year of medical school, precisely when clinical rotations typically begin. Medicine is not just attracting malicious people. Nor can we attribute this to “human nature.” Rather, as working environments, healthcare facilities, and especially ERs, breed cynicism. In fact, you might have a hard time consciously designing a system to do it better.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons this is so. All are related to the context and constraints imposed upon the healthcare system by capitalism. To begin with, hospitals and clinics are businesses. Although they may be called “nonprofits,” they still make profits. This status simply means that they are restricted in the ways they can use those profits. They are still subject to competition on the market for survival, status, investors, and customers. As a consequence, it is still necessary for them to accumulate capital and reinvest it in ways likely to support the greatest future accumulation.</p>\n<p>This is why “nonprofits” typically invest in more profitable healthcare sectors. So, for example, while mental health and emergency services are chronically underfunded, there is almost always money for plastic surgery and orthopedics. Meanwhile, healthcare workers are pushed to see as many patients—and generate as many fees—as possible in a given shift.</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3246\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthcare_crisis_dr.jpg\" alt=\"healthcare crisis dr\" width=\"460\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthcare_crisis_dr.jpg 500w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthcare_crisis_dr-300x178.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /></p>\n<p>In most inner-city emergency rooms, one can expect to wait several hours and sometimes far longer even to be seen. Of course, once you get to the other side and are seen, everyone is moving frantically, constantly behind, and you will be lucky to get longer than a few minutes at a time with a provider. There are not enough beds, providers, nurses, technicians, social workers, case managers, pharmacists, interpreters, equipment, or anything else. On top of this, it is not uncommon where I work for inpatients to be boarded in the Emergency Department because there are not enough beds available in the inpatient wards, further stressing the available resources. At the same time, supervisors are constantly putting the screws to providers to see more and more patients, on nurses to do more with less. One supervisor at my hospital recently started publicly posting providers’ average patient-per-hour statistics in an attempt to provoke competition and put pressure on those who are “underperforming.”</p>\n<p>Taking a step back, we can see even deeper problems. Capitalism is an alienating system. Human beings are fragmented and their various aspects isolated in different realms. Healthcare is supposed to treat exclusively “medical” problems. Never mind that one’s health problems might be related to environmental hazards or a precarious living situation, insufficient nutrition, lack of education and health literacy, and nonexistent social support networks.</p>\n<p>Healthcare providers are not oblivious. Even the most cursory history will reveal these problems. But they feel helpless. Under capitalism, despite the actual availability of all of these resources, there is no social basis to provide them to those in need. As a doctor, one can do very little to provide a homeless person with a home or an isolated person with a community.</p>\n<p>Of course, social work is referred, but in most cases, this is a purely symbolic gesture. Most people simply receive a “list of resources” and are sent on their way. To be faced with such obvious suffering about which one can do so little leads to profound frustration. One copes with cynicism: “that’s their problem” and “it’s not my job.” Furthermore, capitalism is a class society, a society based on the division of human beings into socially differentiated and antagonistic blocks. Class does not simply go away when you walk into a hospital. Ultimately, how one is treated in an emergency room cannot be separated from how one is treated by society as a whole. We are all products of our socialization and no amount of good intentions can change that.</p>\n<p>This is why Marxists do not separate the demand for universal healthcare from the need to overthrow capitalism. Only by taking society’s resources into our collective hands and managing them democratically can we overcome these barriers. We can build new rooms, entire new wards and hospitals, manufacture new equipment, educate and mobilize masses of healthcare workers, and invest in new research and technology. The only reason this doesn’t happen today is because it is not profitable. Socialism will transform the conditions in our hospitals and clinics. Beyond that, a socialist society will begin the large task of ending class divisions and deconstructing the social basis of alienation, oppression, and exploitation. This will lay the basis for a new era of holistic and humane healthcare based on empathy and aimed at preserving the health of individuals and society.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The recent debate around Trumpcare is an example of the constant threat to healthcare under

and young people have begun to fight back against the daily humiliations and injustices which capitalism thrusts on them. Among these is the devastating burden of costs associated with post-secondary education, which has been a constant topic of slow-burning indignation among the youth.</p>\n<p>One of the major points of Bernie Sanders’ presidential platform was to eliminate the cost of tuition in public colleges. This is just one of the reasons he remains the most popular politician in the country, despite his capitulation to the Democratic Party machine. As the ruling class rightly begins to fear for the future of their system, they scramble to co-opt the masses&#8217; demands and turn them into something acceptable and harmless. Of course, something that is harmless to the exploiters, the parasites who feed on our labor and our futures, is rarely something useful for the rest of us. A perfect example is New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s “Excelsior Scholarship” plan for New York City.</p>\n<p>The City University of New York (CUNY), was tuition-free for all those who were accepted between its founding in 1847 to 1975. The end of free CUNY came in at a time when the post-World War II boom came to an abrupt end and the capitalist class was desperate to restore its profit rates. They pressured the government to reduce tax-funded programs, such as welfare, food stamps, unemployment benefits, and public education. This certainly helped those it was intended to help—but was catastrophic for the working class particularly those from its most oppressed layers, whose lives were made that much more precarious. This is an example of what the capitalist state is and whose interests are really behind it.</p>\n<p>Cuomo’s plan is presented as though it would “make CUNY free again,” a long-time slogan of activists in the city, but this is far from the truth. One glaring problem with his plan is who it excludes outright, including part-time students and those who are undocumented. Part-time students make up over 35% of the undergraduate population of CUNY, according to the CUNY Office of Institutional Research and Assessment. These are some of the neediest students, as they are often only studying part-time to accommodate long work hours to cover tuition and living costs. Statistics show that over 30% of students work for more than 20 hours per week. The figures for the number of undocumented students are unavailable but is likely not insignificant. Undocumented students are also generally unable to receive state or federal financial aid, meaning that their exclusion from the Excelsior program is a particularly heavy burden.</p>\n<p>It has also been pointed out frequently among activists as well as ordinary students that the governor&#8217;s plan does not do as much for the poorest students as is claimed. At CUNY, many such students already have significantly reduced or free tuition due to Pell Grants and other government assistance. They mostly struggle with non-tuition costs, such as housing, food, and books, all of which can be overwhelming in a city like New York and which Cuomo’s program doesn’t touch. The greatest benefits will go to the income brackets above these, who already do not have to struggle as hard with the additional costs.</p>\n<p>As for those who do not qualify for the plan, tuition may be increased by an additional $1,000 over the next five years. This increase in revenue will be many times more than what is spent on this scholarship. In the meantime, CUNY’s facilities continue to disintegrate, rats and roaches are a familiar sight to students, there are not enough desks for the students in some classes, and we are forced to seek them out in neighboring rooms. And despite the university’s growing revenue, student activities organizations remain unable to access their allotted funds due to bureaucratic maneuvering and red tape.</p>\n<p>As if this weren&#8217;t bad enough, the scholarship will require that a student takes 30 credits per year—which is well over the requirement to be a full-time student—and maintain a GPA which the school can set as it desires. If performance slips below this for any reason, they will have to pay the now-higher tuition costs. The plan also includes the requirement that, for however many years they received the scholarship, graduates must remain in New York state or else pay back the tuition. Such arbitrariness will rarely align with real students’ lives, which are full of all sorts of unexpected changes in a tight job market that can force people to leave the state or be unemployed.</p>\n<p>And in the final analysis, the &#8220;lucky&#8221; recipients will in effect still be paying for their education, as the state government has ruled out paying for this through higher taxes on the wealthy. It will, therefore, be up to the New York working class to fund the program through taxes.</p>\n<p>The truth is that the “Excelsior Scholarship” is a sneaky attempt at austerity, disguised as a reform. For the past few decades, education and other public spending have been under attack by the capitalist class to increase their profits at the expense of the majority. Without serious opposition, this has led to cuts and the loss of services which are often a matter of life and death. The ruling class’ government will not hand out serious reforms out of the goodness of their hearts, and we cannot expect this. They will not listen to our protests; they will tear our petitions to a thousand pieces.</p>\n<p>But things need not be this way. It is the workers who are the real power in society, while students are the workers of the future and their natural allies in struggle. We must organize, educate, and mobilize students and all workers against the crushing weight of educational costs and the cynical half-measures the ruling class thinks we will buy. Ultimately, we must organize campus and workplace occupations and strikes to clearly pose the question: &#8220;who really runs society?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the labor movement has largely sat out the struggle for free, quality universal education. The current leadership is acting as an appendage of the bosses and has not waged an all-out struggle against these attacks on our lives and futures. They are incapable of recognizing that the interests of the capitalists and their state are incompatible with the working class, and that class collaboration always and inevitably ends in defeat.</p>\n<p>There is also the problem of political representation which does not yet exist for workers young and old. We need a party independent of the Republicans and Democrats, a mass socialist party which will fight for our interests at the ballot box and on the street. All of these struggles must be combined and will not be easy. But if we fight boldly and seriously, victory is assured.</p>\n<p>The right to free education—no catches, no restrictions—will have to be fought for. We have to place responsibility for footing the bill on the bosses. They are sitting on trillions in cash. Their system&#8217;s crisis led to this dire situation, and they will have to pay—not us! The IMT&#8217;s program calls for lifelong learning for all from the cradle to the grave. The capitalist system is incompatible with the full development of individuals, as it is compelled to prioritize the profit of a few people. Since society is not in our hands, even the reforms we do win can be taken away, as they took away free CUNY in 1975. Only by placing the economy under the democratic control of the working class majority can we make sure the wealth we create is used to benefit everyone.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the capitalist crisis drags on, American workers and young people have begun to fight back against the daily humiliations and injustices which capitalism thrusts on them.</p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3243,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[38],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/3244"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=3244"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/3244/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/media/3243"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=3244"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=3244"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=3244"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"featuredMedia":{"id":3243,"date":"2017-05-16T00:43:48","date_gmt":"2017-05-16T00:43:48","guid":{"rendered":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny.jpg"},"modified":"2017-06-27T23:17:42","modified_gmt":"2017-06-27T23:17:42","slug":"attachment-gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny","status":"inherit","type":"attachment","link":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/2017/05/16/cuomo-s-excelsior-swindle/attachment-gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny/","title":{"rendered":"gov andrew cuomo d ny"},"author":1,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"description":{"rendered":"<p class=\"attachment\"><a href='https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny.jpg'><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"gov andrew cuomo d ny\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-300x200.jpg 300w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-768x512.jpg 768w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"100vw\" /></a></p>\n"},"caption":{"rendered":""},"alt_text":"gov andrew cuomo d ny","media_type":"image","mime_type":"image/jpeg","media_details":{"width":1500,"height":1000,"file":"2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"file":"gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-300x200.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-768x512.jpg","width":768,"height":512,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-768x512.jpg"},"large":{"file":"gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-1024x683.jpg","width":1024,"height":683,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-1024x683.jpg"},"twentyseventeen-thumbnail-avatar":{"file":"gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-100x100.jpg","width":100,"height":100,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny-100x100.jpg"},"full":{"file":"gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny.jpg","width":1500,"height":1000,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gov-andrew-cuomo-d-ny.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"AP","camera":"","caption":"New York Gov.

Back in early 2002, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and the “Neo-Cons” ruled the roost. Dissent of any kind was ridiculed and the Left was in full retreat. But instead of hiding in a hole, a handful of comrades of the International Marxist Tendency decided to throw down the gauntlet in the form of a publication centered on a concrete program and perspective for world revolution. We refused to accept that this was the best of all possible worlds, that the end of history had come, and that capitalism had won.</strong></p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"363.04895999999997\">At the upcoming National Congress of the US section of the IMT, we will be discussing the future of Socialist Appeal with a view towards reaching ever wider layers with our ideas. But one thing is clear: Fifteen years since we first went to press, the fundamental ideas we have always defended are more relevant than ever. We have consistently defended the need to break with the Democrats and to form a mass, class independent labor party based on the unions and armed with a socialist program. Concurrently, we must build a revolutionary cadre organization steeped in Marxist theory and class struggle methods to fight against reformism and for a revolutionary internationalist program within a future mass socialist party.</p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"371.3730560000001\">We also tirelessly explained that the “lesser evil” policy eventually leads to the “greater evil” getting back into power. From Bush to Obama to Trump, things seem to have come full circle—but the present situation is not a mere repetition of the past. Much has changed in the last decade and a half. The consciousness of the American workers and youth has been dramatically transformed by the events of the intervening years, above all the Great Recession. Millions of Americans have become radicalized and are now open to socialist ideas and are in favor of revolution.</p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"369.2738559999999\">On November 8, 2016, the unthinkable became a reality. But while the Democratic Party leaders were conceding, making excuses, and propping up the thoroughly undemocratic electoral system, millions of workers and youth spontaneously hit the streets to launch the fight back against Trump. The Democrats’ legalistic “opposition” and “resistance” will do nothing to stop the all-out assault on immigrants, workers, young people, the poor, minorities, and even science itself. It was their policies that led to the current situation in the first place. They “oppose” the Republicans in the same way that Chase Bank “opposes” Bank of America: as friendly rivals over who can get away with screwing over workers the most.</p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"375.9503359999999\">They represent the same capitalist class interests, even if they reflect different wings of that class. Nancy Pelosi was crystal clear when she told a young questioner at a town hall meeting that, “We’re capitalist, that’s just the way it is.” Their primary opposition is to the working class, not to the Republicans. Not only do the Democrats have no confidence in the working class’s ability to change society, but they are terrified of mobilizing those they cynically appeal to vote for them come election time—for fear of things getting out of control.</p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"363.06943999999993\">Republican Raul Labrador recently made the callous claim that “Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.” The Democrats jumped all over him for being “out of touch.” Yet they refuse to fight for single-payer healthcare—although the overwhelming majority of Americans are in favor. During the initial debate over Trumpcare, Paul Ryan let slip that the Republicans aren’t “fit to rule.” We wholeheartedly agree—but would add that neither major party nor their system is fit to determine our destinies any longer. Trump is a faithful reflection of the impasse and absurdity of the capitalist system.</p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"382.38515199999995\">As a result, countless individuals have come to the conclusion that it is not enough to stand on the sidelines. The mass protests against his reactionary policies have been inspiring, but they will inevitably ebb and flow because ultimately, protests will not be enough to stop him and the class he represents. Much more will be needed: ideas, activity, and organization! In an exciting development, thousands have joined DSA and there is growing pressure among the rank and file to break with the Democratic Party once and for all.</p>\n<p data-canvas-width=\"382.38515199999995\">Dozens have also joined the IMT and we are building new branches around the country, from Southern California to Iowa to the Deep South. We have spent a decade and a half painstakingly preparing for just such a situation. So to the question, “What is to be done?” we reply: Help us build the IMT in every workplace, working-class neighborhood, and campus! There is no better time to get involved!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Publishing one hundred issues of a revolutionary Marxist magazine is something of a

src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/scottpruitt631973618.jpg\" alt=\"scottpruitt631973618\" width=\"344\" height=\"197\" />In the multi-front war on the working class being led by the Trump administration, yet another bull has been let loose in the china shop. Scott Pruitt, a professional climate denier and opponent of environmental regulations, has been confirmed as the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. With global atmospheric CO2 now exceeding the critical threshold of 410 parts per million, the last thing humanity needs is a climate skeptic with ties to the fossil fuel industry helming the agency responsible for creating environmental regulations in the country which holds the top spot for pollution per capita.</p>\n<p>In an interview on CNBC in March, Pruitt doubled down on his denial of anthropogenic climate change, stating that he “would not agree that carbon dioxide (from pollution) is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” adding, “we don’t know that.” The EPA website has had its section on climate change hidden, requiring a search before data linking global warming to increases in greenhouse gases and particulate matter in the atmosphere can be found. This change, Pruitt’s office said in a press release, was made “to better represent the new direction the agency is taking.” We can only imagine what course this “new direction” will take: further destruction of the environment in the name of unbridled profit-making, with working people—as always under capitalism—bearing the brunt of whatever catastrophes may follow.</p>\n<p>Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposes to cut the EPA’s federal allocation by 32%, while workforce reduction demands call for the elimination of more than a quarter of the agency’s positions. What better person to institute this brutal austerity than a man who, as attorney general of Oklahoma, filed suit against the EPA fourteen times to roll back regulations on clean air and water, and up until his appointment to office proudly proclaimed on his LinkedIn profile that he was a “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.”</p>\n<p>The EPA employees’ union as well as the Union of Concerned Scientists, to their credit, made an attempt to resist the appointment of the most hostile new director to the stated aims of the agency since its inception. In the end, however, a letter-writing campaign and threats of resignation did little to sway the opinions of two Democratic and all but one Republican Senators. These politicians are all bought and paid for by corporate money including Koch Industries, which is among the top five US producers of toxic waste, spending $3.1 million dollars to “influence lawmakers” prior to the vote, ensuring that Pruitt’s confirmation went off without a hitch.</p>\n<p>Since then, the agency has been undergoing a bureaucratic purge of those reluctant to fall in line and to prepare for deep cuts, while an internal memorandum confirmed that longtime employees are being pushed into retirement, with an offer for “early buyouts.” More recently, it was revealed that Pruitt&#8217;s office had effectively fired half of an 18-member advisory board of scientists in order to make room for ones who have a &#8220;background in industry&#8221;,  adding they hoped to make future policy proposals more &#8220;inclusive&#8221; of the &#8220;regulated community.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3239\" style=\"margin: 6px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/obama_xi_parisaccords.jpg\" alt=\"obama xi parisaccords\" width=\"471\" height=\"240\" />During his campaign, Trump also promised to pull out of the Paris Agreement, the international contract for limiting carbon emissions among the world’s leading polluters, calling it “a bad deal for America.” The motivation is more political than economic. As we’ve pointed out in previous articles in Socialist Appeal, the Paris accords themselves do very little to limit emissions, in the first place because they are virtually unenforceable. Signatories of the agreement set their own benchmarks, based on economic projections, for meeting reduced emission targets—a complete farce of environmental protection policy.</p>\n<p>This allowed the US, for example, to set its goal against emission levels in 2005, which preceded the boom of natural gas in the country, and including huge swathes of the oil and coal industries that have already been permanently phased out, as a part of what it plans to cut. The fact that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson supports staying in the agreement when, under his direction as the company’s CEO, Exxon was fined $21 million for violating the Clean Air Act 16,300 times should indicate the degree to which it is actually capable of stopping flagrant pollution.</p>\n<p>The White House is divided on the Paris Agreement along factional lines. The frenzied, nationalist petty-bourgeois are represented by Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon and Pruitt, while the interests of the big bourgeois are defended by Tillerson and advisor Jared Kushner (Trump’s son-in-law). According to the rigid protectionist dogma of the Bannon wing, the Paris Agreement represents everything anathema about global politics, the mere suggestion that the US should weigh international interests in its economic activity a deadly heresy. The bourgeoisie, however, already bristling over the humiliation of having allowed such mediocrities to rise to the halls of power, recognize the accords as a useful tool in curbing dissent.</p>\n<p>Of course, some of the more short-sighted among the capitalists are eager to ride roughshod over environmental regulations, envisioning a future where operating in the US is more profitable due to even fewer regulatory fines, costly safety and containment procedures, and less scrutiny over where they store their industrial waste. The class as a whole, though, wants to prevent further losses to its credibility and are bringing to bear both the media and their connections within the administration to stop these amateurs from going too far. Tillerson, ahead of a meeting with international partners to discuss Paris-related issues in Bonn, stated publicly that he wishes to stay within the agreement to keep a “seat at the table.” Fox News’s Chris Wallace surprised almost everyone by going for the throat during an interview with Pruitt on April 2, grilling him on his climate denial and demanding to know if he is “comfortable” with the fact that China’s “President Xi is more committed to Paris then the United States is.” With the  G-7 summit on May 26 coming up, which Trump himself is expected to attend, the possibility that he will be curbed away from yet another of his blustering campaign promises seems increasingly likely.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens to the Paris Agreement, the rolling back of environmental protections in the US spells disaster for the world&#8217;s climate. While much of the coal and oil industries have been replaced by “cleaner” natural gas, Trump’s promise to somehow return to an earlier period of energy production before the advent of hydraulic fracturing flies in the face of reality.</p>\n<p>And we should not forget that under the Obama administration, the EPA was forced into functioning as a floundering, inept bureaucracy. It was the Democratic Party that reduced the EPA’s workforce to its lowest levels since the 1970s and cut the agency&#8217;s budget by over 20% prior to the Republican resurgence. Not wanting to impede the fat profits being made by the natural gas industry, the serious environmental dangers posed by fracking to clean water and air went largely unchallenged by the federal government under Obama. All the while, the refusal to tighten regulations on aging infrastructure for pipelines, underground gas storage, and wells led to continuous leaks and disasters. Furthermore, the fact that job losses in coal and oil were not offset by significant investment and job growth in renewables is precisely what led so many former miners and oil workers to tune into Trump’s populism and his promise to end “the war on coal.”</p>\n<p>Outshining the shallow justifications and pandering, the millions who participated in the March for Science, People&#8217;s Climate March, and May Day show there is a strong mood of resistance against these attacks, which is an expression of the underlying process of polarization and the ramping up of class warfare crystallizing under the Trump regime. Many protesters called for an end to the attacks on the EPA and wanted to see immediate action to combat the worst effects of climate change—a position we completely share.</p>\n<p>However, the call to fully fund the EPA assumes that that money will go towards fighting climate change and protecting working people from polluting industries. If the Trump administration has proven anything, it is that with a change of hands and a shift in the winds, a government agency under capitalist control can quickly turn from a regulatory body into a tool for overturning regulations. To transform the EPA into a useful, democratically administered and accountable agency devoted to the protection of the environment, we need a mass workers’ party in power on a socialist program. Such a party would demand paid retraining and relocation with guaranteed employment for displaced workers, prioritize funding for research and development of sustainable technologies and renewable energy sources, and ensure public control and ownership over natural resources and the means of production as part of a rationally planned economy.</p>\n<p>The working class cannot plan what we do not control and cannot control what we do not own. To turn back the rising tide of climate change, we’ll need more than reforms and half-hearted attempts at regulation. When it comes to the environment the question is literally one of life or death. Join us to win the fight against climate change, and create a brighter future for all of humanity!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the multi-front war on the

“Big League” Tax Reform"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><strong> “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something big,” announced Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic advisor, when unveiling the administration’s new tax plan. That “something big” is the transfer of up to $7 trillion into the pockets of the capitalists in tax breaks over the next decade. </strong></p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3235\" style=\"margin: 6px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TrumpTax1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"381\" />With the US currently sitting on its highest level of debt since WWII, the only answer to how everything would be paid for was that “the plan will pay for itself”—as long as the economy maintains a sustained growth rate of 4.5%—a level not seen in decades.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this feat, the proposal aims to slash the corporate tax rate by more than half—from 35% to 15%—and eliminate taxes targeted at the wealthy, such as the estate tax, which targets only the wealthiest 0.2 percent. But high taxes don’t cause economic slumps, and lower taxes aren’t a guarantee for investment and growth. This hastily assembled plan is an attempt to square the circle of capitalist crisis.</p>\n<p>Swiftly approaching the 100-day mark and under pressure to show that he was fulfilling his campaign promises, Trump revealed that he would be announcing a new tax plan within five days. Just days earlier, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected an “aggressive agenda” could deliver reforms by August. While this may explain the incomplete nature of the proposal, the announcement reflects the growing pressure of the more mainstream wing over the “economic nationalist” wing of Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, a “trade skeptic.”</p>\n<p>The announcement decisively put an end to the debate over the “border adjustment tax.” This would have applied a tax on imports in an effort to “level the playing field” for American-made goods and “bring back jobs” by exporting unemployment. While this “America First” approach might benefit a handful of American manufacturers, it also fires a shot into the delicate trade balance and opens the possibility of unleashing a trade war. The capitalists might allow him to erect a wall along the border to stem the flow of people, but a tax wall restricting the free flow of profits is another matter!</p>\n<p>Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns has poured oil on the flames. When he was accused of not paying any federal taxes during the debate he blurted, “That makes me smart!” His administration decries the fact that the US has the third-highest tax rate in the world, but ultimately, these rates are optional for the bourgeoisie who can hire armies of lawyers and accountants to find and exploit loopholes. 258 of the largest 500 companies in the US paid zero in taxes in at least one of the last five years!</p>\n<p>The released plan reads like a wish list for Trump and his heirs. For instance, it eliminates the alternative minimum tax, which forced Trump to pay an additional $31 million in 2005, according to leaked tax returns. Without the AMT he would have paid a tax rate of just 5%. The proposal would also allow business entities called “pass-throughs” (like Trump’s) to be taxed at the newly slashed corporate rate of 15% instead of the individual rate which tops out at 39.6%. And eliminating the inheritance tax will ensure his heirs inherit his fortune free of any tax burdens.</p>\n<p><img class=\" alignleft size-full wp-image-3236\" style=\"margin: 6px; float: left;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mnuchin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mnuchin.jpg 534w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mnuchin-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" />Trump also promises to simplify taxes, reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to three, and doubling the standard deduction. To pay for these cuts, Trump is eliminating nearly all other deductions—including a popular federal deduction for taxes paid at the state level which would cost workers an estimated $1.1 trillion in taxes. The “‘populist” overhaul of the tax code is, in reality, a massive tax cut for the bourgeoisie with the working class footing the bill. One columnist dubbed it a “private stimulus” allowing the corporations to spend instead of the government—but where will they spend it? The only meaningful investment that will stimulate the economy is production, but the market is already unable to absorb the goods that are being produced now.</p>\n<p>If a bit of spending by corporations was all the economy needed, they wouldn’t be sitting on trillions in uninvested cash, let alone the estimated $2.6 trillion stashed in overseas accounts doing nothing more than evading taxes. Instead, as before, we can expect a wave of corporate bonuses, buybacks, and speculation. This “private stimulus” will prove no more effective at resolving the contradictions of the system than previous ones.</p>\n<p>As Marx explained, the bourgeois state is “but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie,” which requires the ability to levy taxes. Nonetheless, some aspects of the state can become a strain on the ruling class, especially in times of crisis. Tax revenue comes from two sources: either cut into the profits of the capitalist class or cut into the wages of the working class. While there can be all kinds of secondary causes, the crisis of the capitalist system is a crisis of overproduction. All attempts by the ruling class to restore balance to the economic equilibrium will only upset the political and social equilibrium.</p>\n<p>Years of austerity and a weak recovery have left no shortage of kindling that could spread like wildfire with any spark. It was the imposition of taxes the Stamp Act that set off the events of the first American Revolution—there’s no saying exactly when or what will set off the next one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something big,” announced Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic advisor, when unveiling the administration’s new tax plan.

turns of life under the Trump regime have a way of making 2016 seem like a distant memory. But with the spectacle of Hillary Clinton joining #TheResistance, and FBI director James Comey&#8217;s sudden dismissal by Trump, just days after testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations that he may have influenced the election, all layers of society are doing some serious reflection on the caucuses and primaries, the election, and the road that led to this point.</strong></p>\n<p>Halfway through the Democratic National Convention last summer, the tag #DemExit began to appear on signs and banners all around Philadelphia, as throngs of Sanders supporters vowed once and for all to abandon the party that had stabbed their hero in the back. In the space of a single week, the way that millions perceived the Democrats was transformed. From one day to the next, hopeful speculation that Bernie would continue to resist and “had a trick up his sleeve” gave way to disappointment and disgust with the corrupt DNC apparatus. This was only compounded when WikiLeaks released the “Podesta emails” that prove the party leadership had conspired to “stick a knife in him.”</p>\n<p>One of the most prominent chants yelled by protesters through the chain-link fences surrounding the DNC convention center as the delegates filed in that week was, “Only Bernie beats Trump!” Polls indicated that Sanders had much higher ratings and better odds against Trump than Clinton did. But at the moment of truth, Sanders wavered, solemnly lowered the banner of the “political revolution against the billionaire class,” and knelt before the Clintonites.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the chants from outside continued to repeat the ominous warning: “Only Bernie beats Trump!<span tabindex=\"0\">” But ever since this proved correct on the night of November 8, Sanders has only tightened his embrace of the party.</span> Instead of concluding that the Democrats cannot be a vehicle for working-class struggle, and using his authority to spur the creation of a mass socialist working-class party, Sanders has become one of its most tireless apologists.</p>\n<p>Bernie’s journey from tragedy to farce recently took the form of a road trip through nine states together with the new DNC chair and former Labor Secretary, Tom Perez. Like all establishment politicians, Perez speaks only in the evasive language of meaningless banalities—that and a few words of embarrassingly broken Spanish. During the primaries, he personally assured the Clinton campaign he would “put a fork into” Sanders’ Latino support, and cynically encouraged Clinton to go after Sanders by casting him as the candidate of “angry white men” who was out of touch with minorities.</p>\n<p>During the race for DNC chair, Bernie supported Keith Ellison against Perez. Widely seen as the “progressive” candidate, and an early supporter of the Sanders campaign, Ellison is among those who recognize the need for a leftward posture in the aftermath of 2016. But the Democrats chose Perez, and Sanders fell in line—again.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin: 6px; float: left;\" src=\"https://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/31/10/33343e6a489eb54957e6e822b250/170424-sandersperez-editorial.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for UNity tour perez sanders\" width=\"359\" height=\"244\" />At almost every stop on the “unity tour,” Perez was met with boos, while Sanders was cheered enthusiastically. In one city after another, he allowed himself to act as a human sponge to soak up the discontent permeating the very party, which, as one attendee at a recent rally put it, “kinda shafted him.” While the tour itself was widely viewed as a failure and a further indication of a crisis of leadership within the party, Sanders himself continues to enjoy higher approval than any other politician, according to recent polls. Despite his ill-fated project to push the Democratic Party towards the socialist left, two main factors account for the enduring loyalty of Bernie’s base:</p>\n<p>Firstly, it shows the powerful appeal of at least talking about class and socialism, if not class struggle and socialist revolution. Since 2008, the mass expressions of discontent in the US have had a spontaneous, leaderless, and politically vague form: Wisconsin, Occupy, and Black Lives Matter. Sanders became the personification of the mood in society when he stepped forward as shamelessly self-avowed socialist and advocate of a “political revolution against the billionaire class.” For this, he has won a degree of trust and respect that is alien to most bourgeois politicians.</p>\n<p>This leads to the second factor: the vacuum. With no mass party or figurehead of prominence to the left of Sanders and the Democrats, and faced with near-daily attacks from the Trump administration, the urge for immediate action to fight back using whatever tools are presently on hand drowns out the need to first construct an effective tool. DNC operatives and the liberal bourgeois are cautiously following his every step and remark, asking themselves, “Can Sanders save the Democratic Party?” But what most concerns our class is whether Sanders will help or hamper the creation of a mass, socialist, working-class party. Building such a party is the most pressing task we face.</p>\n<p>Given the vacuum and lack of alternatives, Sanders could still play a role in upending US politics. But he appears to have decisively answered the question, “what will Bernie do?” As long as he continues to work with the Democrats, he is helping to preserve the two-party system and the rule of capital. 2016 revealed the extent to which the two parties of capitalism have destroyed their legitimacy. The potential for the emergence of a new mass party that would radically transform the political landscape is closer than ever, but it must be based on a program of open class struggle against capitalism if it is to do more than simply let off steam.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The daily twists and turns of life under the Trump regime have a way of

the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, was exiled in Zurich, Switzerland.</strong></p>\n<p>As the first reports arrived of these extraordinary events, Lenin’s excitement was coupled with exasperation that he himself was separated from them by thousands of miles. “I am beside myself that I cannot go to Scandinavia!!” he complained bitterly, in a letter to his friend Inessa Armand. “I will not forgive myself for not risking the journey in 1915!”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“[Social] change never takes place ‘by itself’; it always needs the intervention of men, who are thus confronted with great social problems. And it is those men who do more than others to facilitate the solution of these problems who are called great . . .” (G V Plekhanov, On the Role of the Individual in History)</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“On the 3rd of April Lenin arrived in Petrograd from abroad. Only from that moment does the Bolshevik Party begin to speak out loud, and, what is more important, with its own voice.” (Leon Trotsky, <em>The History of the Russian Revolution</em>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Immediately after hearing about the revolution, Lenin resolved to return to Russia and play a part in the events to come. Over the next weeks followed urgent correspondences between Switzerland and other Bolshevik exiles and those running the Bolshevik center in Petrograd, as Lenin prepared to join them. Even before his arrival on the scene he was providing analysis of the situation in the party newspaper <em>Pravda</em> (<a href=\"https://www.bolshevik.info/letters-from-afar.htm\">Letters from Afar</a>) and outlining revolutionary tactics: “. . . the struggle against imperialism, as before revolutionary propaganda, agitation and struggle with the aim of an international proletarian revolution and the conquest of power by the ‘Soviets of Workers’ Deputies’ (and not the Cadet swindlers).”</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"display: block; margin: 6px auto;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgkiX3GCyEc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In the final days of March, Lenin, along with other socialists in Switzerland embarked on the dangerous journey to Scandinavia via war-torn Germany. As soon as he arrived at Petrograd’s Finland Station on April 3, he gave a speech to his fellow Bolsheviks denouncing the provisional government and calling for international socialist revolution.</p>\n<p>The party center he found in Russia’s capital was completely at odds with the revolutionary vanguard which would lead the October insurrection little more than six months later. In Lenin’s absence, not a single Bolshevik deputy had opposed the Petrograd Soviet’s approval of the Russian bourgeoisie’s provisional government. To make matters worse, when Kamenev and Stalin arrived from exile in mid-March, they proceeded to turn <em>Pravda</em> towards giving critical support to the new government, including its policy of continuing the war with Germany!</p>\n<p>Lenin wasted no time in criticizing the mechanistic approach of Kamenev to the “bourgeois revolution” before reading his famous “Theses” on the tasks of the Russian proletariat the day after his arrival in Petrograd. By the time Petrograd conference of Bolsheviks took place at the end of the month, having been virtually a minority of one only weeks before, Lenin was winning the majority of the party to his position. The importance of this change in the party line to the success of the October Revolution cannot be overstated. Lenin alone among the Bolsheviks at that stage recognized that only the Russian working class had the potential to carry through the revolution. His perspectives confirmed those of his fellow great revolutionary Leon Trotsky, who would join him at the head of the Bolshevik Party in just a few short months. On the basis of Lenin’s formulations, the Bolsheviks grew exponentially from being a tiny minority to winning the majority of the Soviets and leading the Revolution itself.<img style=\"margin: 6px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.bolshevik.info/images/stories/images/lenin.jpg\" alt=\"lenin\" width=\"543\" height=\"386\" /></p>\n<p>This reading guide contains a selection of Lenin’s most important writings and speeches from the April period, accompanied by works which provide further details of events at that stage of the Revolution.

Even as the video of the incident went viral and made global headlines, United Airlines CEO Oscar Muñoz initially remained completely unapologetic, insisting that the company was fully within its rights by referring to the fine print listing terms and conditions, which all passengers “agree to” upon purchasing a ticket.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite a later setback caused by a threatened consumer boycott, United&#8217;s stock actually rose immediately upon the breakout of the story, as speculators considered this incident indicative of the airline’s willingness to be <span style=\"background-color: initial; font-size: 1em;\">“</span>cost effective.<span style=\"background-color: initial; font-size: 1em;\">”</span> In a highly monopolized industry like air travel, the market rewards those companies which treat their customers like barely tolerated inconveniences. The media, meanwhile, always quick to do a hatchet job on those who suffer the viciousness of police brutality, responded by digging up details on the personal life of the victim, David Dao. This hitherto ordinary gentleman, who already suffered more than enough at the hands of United, now has to endure the scrutiny of millions while unable to defend himself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A few days after the incident incensed the public, it was reported that United incurred a <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/uniteds-stock-is-set-to-fall-5-and-wipe-1-billion-off-the-airlines-market-cap-2017-04-11\">loss of around $255 million</a> in stock from the PR fiasco. It would be incorrect to view this as a victory, however, as this speculated loss in no way damaged United’s position as one of the few choices American people have for air travel.</p>\n<p>Nearly 70% of the airline industry is in the hands of four companies: American, Delta, Southwest, and United—the latter alone accounting for a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/250577/domestic-market-share-of-leading-us-airlines/\">market share of 14.5%</a>. With their enormous capital, these companies are often the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/01/united-airlines-launches-an-aggressive-domestic-ex.aspx\">only option</a> for passengers traveling to smaller cities via connected flights. Considering United’s plans to <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/01/united-airlines-launches-an-aggressive-domestic-ex.aspx\">aggressively expand</a>, their position is not going to be determined by the opinions of their passengers, who are treated as nothing but a means of obtaining profit, but by the whims of their investors. The need to guarantee profits by selling in excess of supply is why the practice of overbooking is so prevalent, and why customers are contractually required to accept their forced removal from the plane. It is then perfectly sensible, within the logic of the system, that the initial reaction of the stock market was to reward United, <a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/04/10/2187233/traders-appreciate-united-airliness-commitment-to-cost-efficiency-targets/\">via more stock purchases</a>, for brutalizing one of its passengers.</p>\n<p>Behind United is its largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway, helmed by the Democrats’ favorite billionaire, Warren Buffett. The “Oracle of Omaha” and the capitalists he represents also hold shares in all of United’s primary competitors—in fact, they <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/11/united-airlines-stock-passenger-dragged-off-plane-warren-buffett/\">made a net profit </a>through this scandal from the rise in stock price of these companies. Outside of the air travel industry, Berkshire Hathaway also holds stakes in construction, insurance, finance, media, food, and more. For Buffet and capitalists like him, it matters little what value, services, or impact on society their holdings generate. Their only role is to ensure that these companies grow and accumulate profit—by any means necessary.</p>\n<p>In<em> Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism</em>, Lenin delineated a key trait of capitalist society that remains true today: the complete domination of monopoly capital over society. Long gone are the days of the meritocratic “free competition” among similarly sized firms. While this phase of capitalism was no less brutal and exploitative, capitalism was still playing a historically progressive role in developing the productive forces of society. Today, however, we live under a system wherein monopolies concentrate and waste immense productive potential through speculative gambling, exacerbating the recurring crises of overproduction.</p>\n<p>Along with the job losses and austerity policies which such economic downturns always entail, even in times of relative stability, monopoly capitalism “inevitably penetrates into <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch03.htm\">every sphere</a> of public life, regardless of the form of government and all other ‘details’.” Every aspect of our lives as workers and consumers is limited to what these monopolies bring to market, and therefore what is available to buy. In turn, these mega-conglomerates obey no one but their shareholders and the laws of the market. United demonstrates the reality of this “chain of command.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3230\" style=\"margin: 6px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/asian-doc-united-flight.jpg\" alt=\"asian doc united flight\" width=\"444\" height=\"247\" srcset=\"https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/asian-doc-united-flight.jpg 759w, https://socialistrevolution.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/asian-doc-united-flight-300x167.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" />Another aspect of this debacle is the strong implication of racism. Shortly before being brutally wrestled from the seat he had paid for, and dragged senselessly down the aisle by police, David Dao yelled, “I’m being selected because I’m Chinese!” Footage of the incident has rightfully outraged people around the world, especially in China, where it quickly became a trending topic on social media. While the individual prejudice of the airline management and the police probably contributed to the particularly cruel nature of Dao’s treatment, we cannot forget that the greatest fault lies with the capitalists and their system—the interests of profit making are organically linked to the very essence of racism and oppression in general. We must take an active role in combating racism wherever we find it. An injury to one is an injury to all, and this kind of brutality is being carried out with increasing frequency as the social turmoil generated by capitalism in crisis sharpens antagonisms between workers and the state to an untenable degree.</p>\n<p>The selection of David Dao to be thrown off the flight was, in fact, not a random decision. The choice was made by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/amp.usatoday.com/story/100351720/\">a computer algorithm</a> that deemed him to be among the least profitable customers on the plane from the standpoint of the airline. Yet, if Dao had been a frequent first-class flyer with United, or a bourgeois rather than a humble doctor from a small Kentucky town, the company would not have selected him for ejection in the first place, let alone unleash the police upon him when he refused.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"margin: 6px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMTpvzJp4ps\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>While public outrage has put United’s management on a PR defensive, the reality is that consumers in the air travel industry are incredibly limited in their “choice” between just a few gargantuan companies. United may be in the news now for bullying their customers and <a href=\"http://www.seiu.org/2016/06/airport-workers-raise-concerns-at-united-airlines-annual-general-meeting-about-effects-of-low-road-subcontractors-on-passenger-safety\">employing subcontractors</a> on minimum wage, but all of the big airline companies will meanwhile continue to operate this way with little to no consequences. Of course, the government and the two capitalist parties will offer no solution. In fact, the Trump administration has been <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/03/16/donald-trump-budget-air-traffic/\">calling for the privatization of air traffic control</a>, placing passengers’ and workers’ safety at the mercy of private interests to an even deeper degree.</p>\n<p>The only rational solution is to take control of this industry away from a small group of profiteering, monopolizing capitalists and hand it to the people who truly understand how to run it: the workers. After all, as the private property of a private company, the capitalists do indeed have the right to dispose of their property as they see fit. This is why Marxists put forward the demand that the airports and the airline industry be nationalized and placed under the democratic management of the airline workers, pilots, cabin crews, hanger engineers, baggage handlers, and the rest of the air transportation workforce, as well as the unions and the broader public. Freed from the need to make a profit, there is more than enough talent and resources to bring air travel to new heights, while significantly lessening the burden on workers according to a democratically devised plan. This step, in turn, would be part of a national-scale transportation plan, combining air travel with modernized high-speed rail, buses, and subway and highway systems to ensure efficient and convenient transport and distribution.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3f76a60d-6898-e53f-17e3-6c18a7137b23\">In order for such a change to last, this same process of nationalization and democratization must extend to other key sectors of the economy, such as the Fortune 500 companies that now control </span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3f76a60d-6898-e53f-17e3-6c18a7137b23\"><a href=\"https://priceonomics.com/who-is-growing-and-who-is-dying-in-the-fortune-500/\">two-thirds</a></span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3f76a60d-6898-e53f-17e3-6c18a7137b23\"> of America’s GDP, and become integrated into a single economic plan.
